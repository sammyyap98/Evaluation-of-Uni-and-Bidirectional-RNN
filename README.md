# Evaluation-of-Uni-and-Bidirectional-RNN

This work aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of unidirectional and bidirectional recurrent neural networks for sequence prediction. Through a comprehensive evaluation, this work highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each RNN architecture in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. We test four types of RNN cells within the encoder and decoder networks, including unidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Uni-LSTM), bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), unidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Uni-GRU), and bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU).
